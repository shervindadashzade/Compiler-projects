# Compiler's course projects
This repository belongs to undergraduate Compiler Course project which we should build a compiler for Mini C language. This project contains three phases:

- First phase: Lexer implementation without any library just by using pure Python.

- Second phase: Lexer implementation using YACC tools( PLY in Python)

- Third phase: Parser implementation using YACC tools + Semantic analyzer [optional]
